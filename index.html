		<h1>Datsun</h1>
		<p>Datsun is an automobile brand owned by Nissan. Datsun's original production run began in 1931. From 1958 to 1986, only vehicles exported by Nissan were identified as Datsun. By 1986 Nissan had phased out the Datsun name, but re-launched it in June 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets.</p>

		<h2>Datsun 240z</h2>
		<p>The Datsun 240Z began its lifespan back in 1966, when a new sports-car design was created by Fumio Yashida's design team at Nissan. It caught the attention of Yutaka Katayama."Mr. K" was responsible for Nissan's West Coast operations in the U.S. and he was convinced an affordable GT would sell big in America. Yashida's design was just the thing.But Katayama insisted on a closed car, not a convertible -- "easier to get into the market" -- and a two-seater only, not a GT. When the new Datsun sports car finally appeared in the fall of 1969, there was no lack of midpriced European competition, but the sports car would offer Porsche performance and Jaguar style at a fraction of the cost. At home it was called the Fairlady Z, but in the U.S., it would be the Datsun 240Z.Datsun's 240Z was a hit. It started slowly, though before long you couldn't buy a 240Z in the States for the $3,526 list price. But even with the inevitable dealer add-ons and profit taking -- the hallmark of a winner -- buyers recognized a bargain.</p>

		<h2> Datsun 260z and 280z</h2>
		<p>The Datsun 260Z and 280Z represented attempts to maintain sports-car-worthy performance for Datsun's roadster in an era of stiffening government regulations.The term "emissions controls" was synonymous with disappointment for sports car enthusiasts in the 1970s. The compromises necessary to meet exhaust-emissions regulations almost invariably reduced power and drivability. Enthusiasts dreaded the news for each coming year -- how much performance would be lost with the new model? Manufacturers weren't any happier than the enthusiasts. Providing some semblance of the performance that customers expected proved difficult. The reduced power per cubic centimeter -- plus added weight from federally mandated "safety bumpers" and the like -- prompted automakers to add engine displacement to prevent losses in performance. Enter the Datsun 260Z, introduced for 1974. For it, the inline-6 was increased to 2565 cubic centimeters -- or 2.6 liters -- by maintaining the 83.0-mm bore while increasing the stroke from 73.0 mm to 79.0 mm. It restored output to 139 horsepower, but it also lowered the power peak to 5200 rpm. The effective redline fell to 6000 rpm, but Road & Track claimed the engine sounded "labored over 5500." New technology, such as a transistorized breakerless ignition system, increased reliability and aided emissions control. The carburetors still suffered from vapor lock, and although the 260Z was quicker than the last 240Z models, it was still slower than the original Z. And lean surge, the scourge of the 1970s, and dieseling (run-on) remained.The exterior of the Datsun 260Z was changed as little as possible from the 240Z's classic lines. With sports cars allowed a one-year deferral from full compliance with the 5-mph bumper rule, the 1974 Datsun 260Z had discrete black rubber nubs as part of a new bumper system added at the end of the previous model year. The new, heavier bumpers prompted stiffer springs and a rear stabilizer bar.The 1974 models also got the new U.S.-government-mandated seat belt/ignition interlock, a system that prevented the driver from starting the car unless the safety belts of occupied seats were fastened.Nissan also supplemented demand for the Datsun 260Z by adding 11.9 inches to its wheelbase and adding a pair of contoured buckets under a redrawn roofline. The rear seats were really more suited to children than adults, making the 260Z 2+2 Dad's last sports car before getting a family sedan. Most buyers preferred the two-seater, but the 2+2 proved Nissan knew how make the best of a good thing.</p>
